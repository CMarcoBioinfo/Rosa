GENERAL:
    DATA_INPUTS:
        SAMPLES_FILE: "data_inputs/metadata/library_12_2023.csv" # [optional] Path to inputs (fastq/bam) files. (ID and paths)
        WORKING_DIRECTORY: "data_inputs"  # [required] Path to input data tree. Default folder is data_input
        GENOME:  "Ensembl.GRCh37.dna.chr.fa"  # [required] Name of reference file in working_directory/reference/
        ANNOTATION: "GRCh37.p13.SLA.chr.gtf" # [required] Name of gene annotation file in gtf/gff/saf format in working_directory/annotation

    DATA_OUTPUTS:
        WORKING_DIRECTORY: ""  # [optional] Path to working directory. Default: in current directory
        PREFIX: "run_library_trimmed_12_2023"  # [required] Name of run


SPLICELAUCHER:
    INDEX:
        SJDBOVERHANG: "" # [optional] (int) minimum overhang (i.e. block size) for annotated (sjdb) spliced alignments. Default: 99
        GENOMESASPARSED: "" # [optional] (int) suffux array sparsity, i.e. distance between indices: use bigger numbers to decrease needed RAM at the cost of mapping speed reduction. 
        RAM: "" # [optional] (int) maximum avalable RAM (bytes) for genome genration 
        GENOMESAINDEXNBASES: "12" # [optional] (int) length (bases) of the SA pre-indexing string. Typically between 10 and 15. Longer strings will use mush more memory, but allow faster searcges. for small genomes, the parammeter -genomeSAindexNbases must be scaled down to min(14, log2(GenomeLength)/2-1)
